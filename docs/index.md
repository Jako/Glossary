# Glossary

This MODX Extra adds a custom manager page that allows you to create & maintain 
a list of explanations for key terms in your site. Entries into the glossary 
take the form of `term => explanation` where `term` is the phrase being 
described and `explanation` is the description of said term.

### Requirements

* MODX Revolution 2.5+ (maybe works with 2.3+)
* PHP v5.4+

### Features

* Custom Manager Page for maintaining the glossary terms.
* Plugin for highlighting the glossary terms on a page. 
* Snippet for dislaying the terms and explanations.
