# Glossary

This MODX Extra adds a custom manager page that allows you to create and
maintain a list of explanations for key terms in your site. Entries into the
glossary take the form of `term => explanation` where `term` is the phrase being
described and `explanation` is the description of said term. A plugin highlights
each glossary term on a modx resource with the explanation.
