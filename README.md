# Glossary

Manage glossary terms and add them to your site.

## Introduction

This MODX Extra adds a custom manager page that allows you to create and
maintain a list of explanations for key terms in your site. Entries into the
glossary take the form of `term => explanation` where `term` is the phrase being
described and `explanation` is the description of said term. A plugin replaces 
each glossary term on a MODX resource with the glossary term and the description.

## Installation

MODX Package Management

## Usage

Install via package manager and create the glossary terms in the custom manager page.
