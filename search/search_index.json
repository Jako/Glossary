Manual installation If you can't access the MODX Extras Repository in your MODX installation, you can manually install Glossary. Download the transport package from MODX Extras (or one of the pre built transport packages in _packages ) Upload the zip file to your MODX installation's core/packages folder or upload it manually in the MODX Package Manager. In the MODX Manager, navigate to the Package Manager page, and select 'Search locally for packages' from the dropdown button. Glossary should now show up in the list of available packages. Click the corresponding 'Install' button and follow instructions to complete the installation. Build it from source To build and install the package from source you could use Git Package Management . The GitHub repository of Glossary contains a config.json to build that package locally. Use this option, if you want to debug Glossary and/or contribute bugfixes and enhancements. If you want to run the unit tests, you have to rename the file test/properties.sample.inc.php to test/properties.inc.php and change the values in that file (if needed).","title":"Installation"},{"location":"installation/#install-from-modx-extras","text":"Search for Glossary in the Package Manager of a MODX installation and install it in there.","title":"Install from MODX Extras"},{"location":"installation/#manual-installation","text":"If you can't access the MODX Extras Repository in your MODX installation, you can manually install Glossary.

Entries into the glossary take the form of term => explanation where term is the phrase being described and explanation is the description of said term. Included in the package is a snippet called Glossary which will output the glossary terms to a resource page. The snippet is fully templatable using chunks specified as optional parameters to the snippet call, and various features can be turned on or off in the same manner. Snippet This snippet outputs a list of terms and explanations, ordered alphabetically and grouped by first letter. It also ouputs a navigation list of links at the top of the glossary list to allow a user to jump to a specific letter. The following properties could be set in the snippet call: Property Description Default showNav Show the letter nav at the top of the list. 1 (Yes) showEmptySections Show empty sections in the quick-nav bar at the top of the glossary. 0 (No) outerTpl Template chunk for glossary outer wrapper. Glossary.listOuterTpl groupTpl Template chunk for glossary item group. Glossary.listGroupTpl termTpl Template chunk for glossary term items. Glossary.listItemTpl navOuterTpl Template chunk for outer nav-bar wrapper. Glossary.navOuterTpl navItemTpl Template chunk for each item in the nav-bar. Glossary.navItemTpl toPlaceholder If set, will assign the result to this placeholder instead of outputting it directly. 1 - Plugin The Highlighter plugin parses page content field on render and replaces all occurrences of terms with markup defined in the plugin's tpl chunk. This can be used to provide a link directly to the glossary entry for that term. The Plugin could be controlled by the following MODX System settings: Setting Description Default debug Log debug informations in the MODX error log. No disabledAttributes (Comma separated list) Glossary does not replace text inside of this HTML tag attributes. title,alt fullwords Replace only full words of a glossary term in the resource content. 2 Yes html Allow HTML in the explanation (enables a rich-text editor in the term form). Yes resid ID of a resource containing a Glossary snippet call. 0 sections Replace Glossary links only in sections marked with <!\u2014 GlossaryStart --> and <!\u2014 GlossaryEnd --> . The section markers could be changed with the settings glossary.sectionsStart and glossary.sectionsEnd . No sectionsEnd Marker at the end of a section processed by Glossary. The restriction to marked sections can be activated in the setting glossary.sections . sectionsStart Marker at the start of a section processed by Glossary.
